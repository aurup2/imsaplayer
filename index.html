    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>asmiplayer</strong> handles information
        when you use our application.
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        asmiplayer is a media player and media management tool that allows users to
        play and organize <strong>user-provided video content</strong>, including
        online video links and local files.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        asmiplayer does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personally
        identifiable information.
    </p>

        <li>No account registration is required</li>
        <li>No personal data is requested</li>
        <li>No video content is uploaded to our servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>User-Provided Content</h2>
    <p>
        All video URLs and media played in asmiplayer are provided directly by the user.
        asmiplayer does not host, upload, index, or curate any video content.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users are solely responsible for ensuring that they have the legal right to
        access and view any content they play using the app.
    </p>

    <h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
    <p>
        Any video links or media added by the user are stored locally on the user’s
        device only, for the purpose of playback and organization within the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        asmiplayer may use standard Android system components and media libraries
        (such as video playback frameworks) to provide core functionality.
        These services operate according to their own privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
        asmiplayer may display advertisements to support development.
        Advertising partners may use standard technologies such as the
        Advertising ID to deliver and measure ads, in accordance with Google Play policies.
    </p>

        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
